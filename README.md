# Palindrome Checker JS

This repository contains a simple but effective Palindrome Checker application built with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to input text and check if it's a palindrome, meaning the text reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## Local Development

This project uses LiveServer for local development to serve the files and automatically reload the page on changes. If you have LiveServer installed, you can start the server by opening the project directory in your terminal and running:

```bash
live-server
```

If you don't have LiveServer installed, you can install it globally via npm:

```
npm install -g live-server
```
